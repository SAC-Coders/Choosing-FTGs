# Choosing-FTGs
Code to randomly choose FTG Winner

Attached is a jupyter notebook that is designed to choose the FTG winners.

The 'randomness' comes from predetermined seeds that were chosen by other SACers.

Input requirement:

  Main thing that this script assumes is that it is being imported a csv file that has at least 2 columns, where 1 column is named 'Person', and the other column is '# of FTGs' (csv can contain other columns, but they shall be ignored).
  
  'Person' column contains the name of the FTG buyer
  '# of FTGs' column contains an integer, which is the number of FTGs that the person bought
